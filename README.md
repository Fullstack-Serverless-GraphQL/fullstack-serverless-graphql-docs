2.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd Fullstack-Serverless-GraphQL/
    gatsby develop
    ```

    then install the dependancies :

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._
