# Fullstack Serverless GraphQL Docs

This repo is the docs site for the Fullstack Serverless GraphQL course written in Gatsby hooked up to Netlify CMS.

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Clone the repo.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/Fullstack-Serverless-GraphQL/fullstack-serverless-graphql-docs.git
    ```

2)  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-default-starter/
    gatsby develop
    ```

    then install the dependancies :

    ```shell
     yarn install
    ```

1)  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._
