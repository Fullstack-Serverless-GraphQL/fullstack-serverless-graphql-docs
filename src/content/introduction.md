Welcome to Fullstack Serverless GraphQL! This resource is meant to be the most up to date way of building a production-ready serverless GraphQL project.

This is meant for everyone of all skill levels. It follows the Top-Down approach to learning, which is very similar to Fast.ai courses if you have taken them. You are not expected to go learn AWS fundamentals or the basics of REST APIs/JavaScript etc, instead you will learn by doing and explaining what you've done afterwards. This way you focus on what things DO instead of what they ARE.

Most importantly, after you have completed this guide, you need to reimplement what you've learnt here in your own project. This is the only way you can verify that you understand what you've learnt.

However, if you're looking to learning AWS, GraphQL, Vue or React specifically you can easily check out the code on GitHub take what you need.

Everything is built in Node.JS, most of the tools used in the stack can be swapped with something similar like AWS Lambda can be swapped with GCP cloud functions, you just gotta figure out how to adjust your project accordingly. The core concepts of building a GraphQL back-end and consuming it in a front-end are applicable across any provider as long as you understand the fundamentals.

Lastly, when get to the frontend part of the course, you can choose your own adventure in the form of React or Vue. Both are decent examples of how to tackle advanced frontend implementation.
