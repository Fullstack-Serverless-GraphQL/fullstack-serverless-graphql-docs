Welcome to Fullstack Serverless GraphQL! This resource is meant to be the most up to date way of building a production-ready serverless GraphQL project.

This is meant for everyone of all skill levels. It follows the Top-Down approach to learning, which is very similar to Fast.ai courses if you have taken them. You are not expected to go learn AWS fundamentals or the basics of REST APIs/JavaScript etc, instead you will learn by doing and explaining what you've done afterward. This way you focus on what things DO instead of what they ARE.

Make sure you have something working first then go on and research exactly what you've done. Doing it this way may be confusing at first but you will see that it is a faster approach to getting to where you need be. This is designed in a way for you to use these skills to make an impact either by getting a job that uses these technologies or introducing them into your existing stack where ever you work.

Everything is built in Node.JS, most of the tools used in the stack can be swapped with something similar like AWS Lambda can be swapped with GCP cloud functions, you just gotta figure out how to adjust your project accordingly. The core concepts of building a GraphQL backend and consuming it in a frontend are applicable across any provider as long as you understand the fundamentals.
