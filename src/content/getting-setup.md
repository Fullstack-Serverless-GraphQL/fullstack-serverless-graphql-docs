# What you need

* [An AWS Account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup?nc2=h_ct&src=default&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fregistration-confirmation#/start)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* A [Github](https://github.com/)/[Gitlab](http://gitlab.com/) account
* basic knowledge of git
* basic knowledge of HTML/CSS and JavaScript

## Setting Up an AWS account

If this is your first introduction to AWS, I would suggest that you follow the instructions laid out by[ Serverless Stack](https://serverless-stack.com/chapters/create-an-aws-account.html). **Make sure you have an IAM user and the AWS CLI configured as per the instructions.** 

## Git provider

All other tools can run directly from Github or Gitlab, whichever you prefer. Make sure you have a free account with either. This guide uses Github. 

## Git

You will need basic knowledge of [git](https://git-scm.com/) to save your work and automate deployments. It can be [installed here](https://git-scm.com/), while you use the following resources to get yourself up to speed if needs be:
