In this post we will create a Navigation bar and a Header component for our landing page.

Go head and create a `navs` folder and create a `Nav.js` file with the following:

```javascript
import React from "react"

const Nav = () => (
  <nav className="nav border-top flex items-center justify-between flex-wrap bg-transparent p-55 z-100">
    <div className="flex items-center flex-no-shrink text">
      <h1 className="font-display text-red text-2xl">
        <a className="no-underline text-red" href="/">
          Lunar
        </a>
      </h1>
    </div>
  </nav>
)

export default Nav
```

ðŸŒž We have an HTML Nav bar that is is responsive and allows the user to redirect to the Home page of the site.

Next up create a `headers` folder and create a file called `LandingHeader.js` with the following contents:

```javascript
import React from "react"
import { HeadingOne } from "../typography"
const LandingHeader = ({ imgURL, text = "" }) => {
  return (
    <>
      <div
        className=" text-center bg-transparent "
        style={{
          background: `url(${imgURL})no-repeat center center`,
          backgroundSize: "cover",
          height: "570px",
          marginTop: "-85px",
        }}
      >
        <HeadingOne className="text-5xl pt-44 s:text-4xl">{text}</HeadingOne>
      </div>
    </>
  )
}

export default LandingHeader
```

ðŸŒž This is a `div` with a custom style to allow the image to sit in the background of the component. Tailwind CSS has directive and plugins for this sort of thing, however I left this out and went the vanilla route. Do not be scared to code!

ðŸŒž Then we have Vanilla CSS styles for this component as you are unable to replicate this in TailwindCSS.

ðŸŒž Lastly, we have two props for the image URL and whatever text you want to put in the H1.

Once you're done it should look like this:
