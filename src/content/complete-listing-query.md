In this part we get the data from Dynamo And return it.

Back in our query.js file we can import the dynamoDB wrapper at the top of the file:

```
import * as dynamoDBLib from "../../libs/dynamodb-lib";

```

Next up we can create the parameters for our DynamoDB operation:

```
const params = {
    TableName: process.env.ListingsDB || "dev-listings"
  };
```

Just a simple object that has the tablename. reason why we have the or operator is for when we test, Jest cannot pickup the .env file.

Next we have a try catch block that will help us fetch the data and return it:

```
  try {
    const result = await dynamoDBLib.call("scan", params);

    if (result.Items.length === 0) {
      return "You have no listings";
    } else {
      return result.Items.map((i) => ({
        listingId: i.listingId,
        coverPhoto: i.coverPhoto,
        listingName: i.listingName,
        listingDescription: i.listingDescription,
        listingType: i.listingType.map((m) => ({
          name: m,
        })),
        listingLocation: i.listingLocation,
        listingActivities: i.listingActivities.map((k) => ({
          name: k,
        })),
        specialType: i.specialType,
        specialAmount: i.specialAmount,
        rating: i.rating,
        guide: {
          Name: i.guide.name,
          Bio: i.guide.bio,
          Avatar: i.guide.avatar,
        },
        price: i.price,
        numberOfDays: i.numberOfDays,
      }));
    }

    // return result;
  } catch (e) {
    return {
      message: e.message,
      code: "500x",
    };
  }
```

ðŸ”‹First we return a promise and execute a scan on Dynamo and pass through our params object.

ðŸ”‹We have an if - else block to check if the is no listings, if they are return all the listings

ðŸ”‹Because we are returning an array we need to map over each element in the array and returning each field in the object.

ðŸ”‹In the case of the ListingType & ListingActivies these are nested arrays within the listing object itself, which we look over to return each element in the array.

ðŸ”‹ In the case of the guide all we are doing is return back the properites in the guide object.

ðŸ”‹ Lastly we return an error message and code in the case anything fails.

Next lets now go to Playground and test the query by executing the following query:

[ADD PLAYGROUND IMAGE]

Now the function returns our data as we have shaped it.
