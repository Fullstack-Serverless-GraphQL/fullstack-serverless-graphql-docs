In this post we will manually add listings to DynamoDB. Usually we could create a mutation to add listings for someone. But for the sake of this course I've created all the listings for you.

Open then here and copy the entire file.

Next go over to the AWS console.

Select DynamoDB

Then search for your table and select it

Select the items tab

Then click create item

and add the first row.

Then click save.

Repeat this process till you have a minimum of 3 listings. You can always add more listings at a later stage.
