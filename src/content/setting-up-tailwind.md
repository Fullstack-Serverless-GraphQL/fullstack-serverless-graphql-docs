TailwindCSS is a utility first library for styling HTML. It is not library with components like Ant Design, Bulma etc. You still need to create those components yourself, however , it gives you a better developer experince for styling your HTML. 

Since all the necessary installation steps are done via the React Bleeding Edge Kit, all we need to do is replace the default \`\`\`tailwind.config.js\`\`\` file with the one that will mirror the design system for the Lunar Tour. 

Here is a link to the file. copy its contents and replace it with the contents of the \`\`\`tailwind.config.js\`\`\` in the root of the project.

Pretty simple task. Now we can start creating the UI components.
